  - The peak hours for ride sharing is betweem 5pm and 6pm.

  - From this map, we can see the most popular starting location for riders. Knowing that we can create similar visualizations for 
    Des Moines, we would be able to determine where would be the top starting locations and we would be able to make more bikes 
    available in those locations.

  - This graph gives us an idea of how many bikes are being checked out and how long they have been checked out for.

  - This graph goes more in to depth to show which gender is checking out bikes more. More males are using the ride sharing service in NYC.

  - This service is being used mostly Monday-Friday during the hours of 7am-9am and Monday-Tuesday 5pm-6pm. The bike sharing service
    is used mostly on Thursday evenings from 5pm-6pm.

  - This chart shows us that males are the ones using the ride sharing service.

  - This chart shows us that males are mostly using the ride sharing service during the week and they are mostly subscribers to the service.

## SUMMARY 
    
    From the data visualization for NYC Bike Sharing above, we can use this information to create a similar and even better ride sharing 
    program in Des Moines, Iowa. By using the peak hours information, we would be able to raise the price for ride sharing during those times, 
    and lower the price at non-peak hours. We can also determine the top starting locations in Des Moines and strategically make more bikes 
    available at those locations. From the rest of the data visualization, we can see that this service is being used by mostly males. I can only 
    assume that females and others are not utilizing this service in fear of their safety. 
    
    Two additional visualizations that should be used for future analysis are:
    
    - a chart showing peak hours for females and others only.
    - a chart showing where females and others are mostly using this service.
    
    By doing these additional visualizations, we can have an idea of when and where females and others feel safe to use this service. 
    Having this data should allow us to make the service more inclusive, safe and welcoming to females and to others. Not only would they have more 
    options, but the ride sharing business in Des Moines would thrive since everyone would be using the service.
