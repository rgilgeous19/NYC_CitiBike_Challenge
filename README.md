# NYC CitiBike Challenge

## OVERVIEW

### _Purpose of the Project_

  The main purpose of this project is to use the data visualization and analysis from the NYC Bike Sharing data
  to convince investors that this same concept can work in Des Moines, Iowa. 
  
## RESULTS

  - The peak hours for ride sharing is betweem 5pm and 6pm.

  - From this map, we can see the most popular starting location for riders. Knowing that we can create similar visualizations for 
    Des Moines, we would be able to determine where would be the top starting locations and we would be able to make more bikes 
    available in those locations.

  - This graph gives us an idea of how many bikes are being checked out and how long they have been checked out for.

  - This graph goes more in to depth to show which gender is checking out bikes more. More males are using the ride sharing service in NYC.
